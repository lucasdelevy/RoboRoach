[[How to install it?]]

It's probably installed already, but in case it's not:
- Insert Polaris CD
- $ cd /media/needle/PolarisCD4.005.007/Linux/ToolBox
- $ ./install.sh

If it doesn't work, you're probably lacking some 32 bit libs.
- $ sudo -i
- $ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
- $ echo "deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring main restricted universe multiverse" >ia32-libs-raring.list
- $ apt-get update
- $ apt-get install ia32-libs

Then run it again:
- $ ./install.sh
- Follow the installation wizard
- Keep the Desktop icons

[[How to run it?]]
1) Plug everything together.
- Dark box with power
- Dark box with PC
- Dark box with Polaris
- Plug also two active tags.
2) Turn it on
3) Wait until Polaris LEDs stop blinking
4) At this point, all LEDs must be green (except for active markers)
5) If you try to run it right now, nothing happens. Sudo do it, two ways:
- $ sudo nautilus
- Navigate until Desktop icons
- Run it
or
- $ sudo /bin/sh "/home/needle/NDIToolBox/XXXXX", XXXXX = Capture, Config, Track

[[How to run the driver?]]
The driver is found here (http://sourceforge.net/p/polarisdriver/code/ci/master/tree/scripts/)
But it's also in ~/Desktop/Polaris/polaris_api.py. So:
- $ sudo python ~/Desktop/Polaris/polaris_api.py
At this point specifically you'll need both markers (as the code is written)
